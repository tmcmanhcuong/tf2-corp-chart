## Context

The TechX Corp microservices platform runs 30 workloads under continuous load testing (via Locust load generator). The initial configuration in `values.yaml` contained arbitrary resource requests and limits that did not reflect actual application behavior or requirements.

This led to major inefficiencies:
- **Over-provisioning (Waste):** Lightweight services (e.g., `shipping` in Rust, `quote` in PHP, `product-catalog` in Go) had request floors of 50m-100m CPU and 100Mi-256Mi memory, wasting compute capacity and preventing Karpenter from performing node consolidation.
- **Under-provisioning (OOM Risk):** AI workloads (`product-reviews`, `shopping-copilot`) had memory limits set at 2Gi, while their actual memory footprints under model loading were ~1.78GiB and ~1.72GiB respectively, risking OOMKills under peak traffic.
- **Probe Throttling:** Setting CPU limits too tightly on JVM (`ad`), Node.js (`payment`), or `metrics-server` caused liveness probe timeouts during cold start, leading to container restart loops.
- **ValidatingAdmissionPolicy Compliance:** Cluster security policy `runtime-hardening-pod-template.techx.io` (Mandate 5) requires all containers to explicitly define both CPU and Memory requests and limits.

To resolve these issues, we collected metrics under active load testing:
1. **P99 CPU & Memory metrics** from a **30-minute load test window under 50 active users**.
2. **Prometheus metrics & Grafana dashboard (`webstore-performance.json`)** to cross-verify container resource usage and allocation stats.

## Decision

We right-sized CPU and Memory resource configurations across all 30 microservices and infrastructure components in `values.yaml` based on empirical P99 metrics and Kubernetes Quality of Service (QoS) classification rules:

### Sizing Methodology
1. **Guaranteed QoS (Request = Limit):** Applied to critical transaction path services (`checkout`, `cart`, `payment`, `frontend-proxy`, `product-catalog`, `currency`, `quote`, `shipping`) and core platform infrastructure (`prometheus-server`, `opensearch`, `otel-collector`, `prometheus-adapter`, `metrics-server`). Setting `requests = limits` prevents noisy-neighbor CPU starvation and guarantees eviction protection.
2. **Burstable QoS (Request < Limit):** Applied to non-transactional, bursty, or AI/ML workloads (`frontend`, `product-reviews`, `shopping-copilot`, `recommendation`, `llm`, `ad`, `accounting`, `fraud-detection`, `email`, `flagd`, `jaeger`, `grafana`, `kube-state-metrics`, `image-provider`, `load-generator`, `load-generator-worker`, `flagd-ui`). CPU limits are set with generous headroom (3x–10x over requests) to satisfy `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` while preventing cold-start probe timeouts.
3. **Memory Requests & Limits:** Memory requests are set with a 15–30% safety buffer over P99 memory usage to prevent scheduling on memory-constrained nodes. Heavy AI services (`product-reviews`, `shopping-copilot`) have memory requests set to 1920Mi and limits to 2560Mi to accommodate model binaries safely. `flagd` is configured with `limits.memory: 128Mi` (requests `64Mi`) to align with `GOMEMLIMIT: 100MiB` and prevent OOMKills under heavy gRPC feature-flag query volume.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Zero CrashLoopBackOff & 100% Pod Health:** Eliminated all cold-start probe failures (`ad`, `payment`, `metrics-server`, `flagd`) while preventing OOMKills on heavy AI/analytics workloads (`product-reviews`, `shopping-copilot`, `opensearch`, `prometheus-server`, `flagd`).
- **Cost Optimization & Bin-Packing:** Reduced CPU requests on idle workloads (from 100m to 5m-20m), enabling Karpenter to pack pods efficiently and scale down unnecessary EC2 nodes under low traffic.
- **Strict Policy Compliance:** Fully satisfies `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` (`runtime-hardening-pod-template.techx.io`), ensuring seamless CI/CD merging into `main`.
- **Noisy Neighbor Protection:** Critical purchase path services are isolated with Guaranteed QoS (`request = limit`).

### Negative / Trade-offs
- **Cold-Start Burst Overhead:** Heavy JVM (`ad`), Node.js (`payment`), and Go (`flagd`) pods require slightly higher CPU limits (`100m-200m`) during startup, but their steady-state CPU footprint remains minimal (`10m`).
