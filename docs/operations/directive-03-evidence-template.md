## Baseline

- k6 start (UTC):
- Maintenance dashboard interval:
- Browse success:
- Cart success:
- Checkout success:
- Storefront p95:
- Baseline screenshot/link:

## Controlled disruption

- Candidate node:
- Mentor approval time (UTC):
- Cordon time (UTC):
- Drain start/end (UTC):
- Replacement pod Ready time(s):
- Minimum Ready endpoints observed per critical service:
- SLO screenshot/link during drain:
- Alerts or anomalies:

## Recovery and result

- Uncordon time (UTC):
- Five-minute post-maintenance observation completed:
- Browse success:
- Cart success:
- Checkout success:
- Storefront p95:
- k6 exit code:
- k6 summary/log attachment:
- Final pod/PDB/EndpointSlice attachment:
- Result: PASS / ABORT / FAIL
- Mentor confirmation:

Acceptance is PASS only when checkout is at least 99%, browse/cart are at least
99.5%, storefront p95 is below one second, k6 exits zero, and no critical
service reaches zero Ready endpoints.

## Residual risk and follow-up

- Stateful singleton owner:
- Kafka follow-up:
- `valkey-cart` follow-up:
- Any incident/change ticket:
